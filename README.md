## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT
In the current digital era, where photographs are shared digitally, there is growing concern for sharing them publicly. Nowadays, there is more potential to misuse someone’s face with deepfakes and face spoofing. Hence in many institutions like kindergartens and schools, they address it with most care to share students’ pictures with concerned parties only. 
Presently, the institutions make an effort to not share their student’s' photographs with everyone. They share photos of kids to their respective parents only. However, the parents are still able to view other kids, who are present in those photos, together with their own.

In institutions like kindergartens, the number of pictures the teachers click every day on each student’s activities is too many. If it’s an individual activity, they make sure to capture only one student in each photo. But with activities involving multiple children, they don’t have the time to capture a single child in each picture. So even though they share the picture of each child with their parents, they end up sharing some pictures of group activities with many children, which ends up as a privacy concern.

The current approach of teachers manually sorting the pictures of each child in the bunch of photos taken every month is very time consuming. The sheer number of pictures taken makes it difficult too. Hence there is always potential for human error resulting in sharing of photographs to unintended recipients and failure to share with the intended recipient.

Our team aims to create an efficient intelligent system that automates the tedious, time-consuming task of sharing particular photographs with concerned parties.
